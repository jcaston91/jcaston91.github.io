1.	I will be doing my project on the used car market. A couple of references that I will be looking at is Kelly blue book, Car fax, all concerns that new cars may have on the market, Car Guru, and Craigslist. My dataset will come from Kaggle and it is known as Vehicles. I have a couple questions that I am hoping to get answers from through my analysis. Two of the bigger question I am looking to answer are: 1.What model of vehicles retains the best value? 2. Most available model of vehicle in later years.
