# Pizza Restaurants

This is one of my first projects that I created and experimented with. This is my plan and approach that I plan to take with this dataset. The data was provided by Datafiniti's Business Database, but collected on Kaggle. It is important to note that this is only a sample data set just and to get the full data set you could go through Datafiniti. Pizza interest me because it feels that every different region has their style of pizza along with their styles of toppings. [here] https://github.com/jcaston91/Pizza_Restaurants
