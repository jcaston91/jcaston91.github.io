# Pokemon Case Study

This is the original Pokemon Case study that I did, so this was my first time seeing the dataset. There were a couple of methods that I did try and many more that I wanted to try. So you may see some imported packages that are not used these are encouraged for anyone who chooses to try this case study to do the extra methods and see what results you get. The Code is found [here](https://github.com/jcaston91/Pokemon)
