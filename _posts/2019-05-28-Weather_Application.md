# Weather Application

This was one of my favorite projects that I did. It was one of the few times that I worked with an API. Working with API's is a must have skill for this or be able to pick it up as you go. For this assignment it is simple to explain. I connected to an API and customized my calls to pull down what information that I wanted after the user input either a city or zip code. All of the data that was passed on by JSON. SO experience with working with JSON's is a plus, but you can also learn as you go. I really enjoyed this project and would encourage everyone to take a shot at this project and customize it how you want.
