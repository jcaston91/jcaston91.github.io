# Suicide Rate Project

The new data set that I have chosen is in the domain of suicides. This data set takes data from many different countries, age groups, and both sexes. During this project I performed Linear Regression, Correlation Matrix, and K Means Clustering. I built some user input methods so that a user can input the required data in and get the predicted suicide rate based on the linear regression model that I built.

The Code is found [here](https://github.com/jcaston91/Suicide_Rates_Project)
