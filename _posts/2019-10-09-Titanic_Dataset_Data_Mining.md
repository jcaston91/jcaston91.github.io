# Titanic Data Set

This project was an ongoing project that I did starting from the more easy task of exploring the data set and eventually moving on to data mining. One of the key things performed here is where I learned to do Feature Reduction (Extraction/Selection). This this then lead us to do so graphical analysis.

The Code is found [here](https://github.com/jcaston91/Titanic_Dataset_Data_Mining)
