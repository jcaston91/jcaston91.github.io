# working with big Data

For this part of the exercise we will load a comma-separated value (CSV) file into Spark as a text file. We will practice with Filtering, Sorting, and Counting the data. One again this was my first time working with big data and spark so we will start with some pretty easy task so that we can get used to the syntax of spark. 
The Code is found [here](https://github.com/jcaston91/PySpark_Working_With_Big_Data)

If you do not have spark installed on your system then that will be the first step. 

Running Spark directly on Windows is possible. Below are guides on how to install and configure Spark on Windows.
