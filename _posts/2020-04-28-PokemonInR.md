# Pokemon Project in R

The Data For this project I will be taking a dive into the world of Pok√©mon. This data set was one that I have played around with before, but all of that analysis was done in python. I have not done much coding within the R programming language so I felt that this would be a great opportunity to experiment a little more with the R programming language and show my versatility in using two different coding language while doing some of the same analysis methods.
