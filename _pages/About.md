Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I am a Data Scientist who currently works at Boeing in the Finance department. I am originally from Louisiana, but I know live in the Seattle, WA area. I am an Air Force Veteran where I worked primarily as an aircraaft mechanic. I went back to school because I love learning new skills and always want to challenge myself. I love working with machine learning, exploratory analysis, and data visualization. I also hold a bachelors in Cybersecurity. If you have any questions feel free to contact me.
